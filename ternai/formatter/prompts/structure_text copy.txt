Your task is to process travel-related text and transform it into a valid JSON. 

You should map the activities to a day number. Extract Activities (distinct elements of the itinerary) Use the following categories to classify the information:

Lodging: Includes overnight accommodations like camping, hotels, etc.
Transfers: For moving from one point to another, such as trains, ferries, taxis.
Flights: Specifically for air travel.
Informational Blocks: Any unstructured information about the trip.
Activities: Sports, theater experiences, hiking, etc.

activityName: The name of the activity or event.
details: ALL Text about the activity. Any text you find about this activity should be added verbatim. The more text here the better. 
category: One of the specified categories (Lodging, Transfers, Flights, Informational Blocks, Activities).

Handle Ambiguities: If any information is unclear make an educated guess based on the context or leave the field appropriately blank.

Respond only in RFC8259 compliant JSON response following this format without deviation. Do not include newlines or extra characters at the start or end. A sample has been provided below:

"[{"day":"1", "activityName": "Hotel Stay","details": "ALL DETAILS HERE","category": "Lodging"},{"day":"2:,"activityName": "City Tour","details": "ALL DETAILS HERE","category": "Activities"}]"
