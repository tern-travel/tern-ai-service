Guidelines:

Ensure date and time consistency across entries.
Assume all fields are optional. If there isn't data for a field leave it blank. 
Validate the JSON for format and data consistency.
Respond only in RFC8259 compliant JSON response following this format without deviation.
Do not provide any preface to the JSON and do not provide any notes. The first characters should be "[ and the last ]"
