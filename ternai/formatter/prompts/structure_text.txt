Task: Convert the provided itinerary details into a structured JSON file. Activities should be grouped by day, with days numbered accordingly. Each activity type (Lodging, Activity, Transfer) has specific fields that must be included in the JSON objects. You should include all information possible from the original text in the description field. 

Lodging: Represent sleeping accommodations. Includes checking in and out of hotels. Format:

{
  "title": "Title of Lodging",
  "check_in": "Date and Time in UTC",
  "check_out": "Date and Time in UTC",
  "activity_description": "Full description of the activity",
  "type": {
    "name": "Lodging"
  }
}

Activity: Details of activities. These include education activities, Food and Drink, Freetime, Gaming/Gambling, Museum, Nightlife, Other, Outdoors + Nature, Shopping, Show, Sports, Theme Park, Tour, Wellness. All of these should be of type activity with the closest subtype.

{
  "title": "Title of Activity",
  "start_at": "Start Date and Time in UTC",
  "end_at": "End Date and Time in UTC",
  "activity_description": "Full description of the activity",
  "subtype":"Food and Drink",
  "type": {
    "name": "Activity"
  }
}

Transfers: Details how people move between locations. Transfer subtypes are Transfer, Train, Ferry, Rental Car, and Other. Format:

{
  "title": "Title of Transfer",
  "start_at": "Start Date and Time in UTC",
  "end_at": "End Date and Time in UTC",
  "activity_description": "Full description of the activity",
  "type": {
    "name": "Transfer"
  },
  "subtype":"Rental Car"
}

Flights represent travel via airplane via airports. Format:  

{
  "title": "Flight from MSO to Aus (DL1544)",
  "activity_description": "Full description of the activity",
  "flights": [
    {
      "airline_code": "DL",
      "airline_name": "Delta Air Lines",
      "flight_number": "1544",
      "departure_airline_code": "MSP",
      "arrival_airline_code": "AUS",
      "departure_time": "Sun, 24 Dec 2023 10:00:00 UTC +00:00",
      "arrival_time": "Wed, 27 Dec 2023 10:00:00 UTC +00:00"
    }
  ],
  "type": {
    "name": "Flight"
  }
}

You should put these together into a single trip object that has a title. Each day has a day count representing the order the activities appear on the trip. Create a title that represents the trip. Sample JSON Structure:

"{
  "title":"Created Trip Title",
  "days":[{
    "day_order":"1",
    "activity": [...],
  },
  {
    "day_order":"2",
    "activity": [...],
  }]
}"

Guidelines:

Ensure date and time consistency across entries.
Assume all fields are optional. If there isn't data for a field leave it blank. 
Validate the JSON for format and data consistency.
Respond only in RFC8259 compliant JSON response following this format without deviation.
You should escape characters as needed to ensure valid json.
Do not provide any preface to the JSON and do not provide any notes. The first characters should be "{ and the last }"
